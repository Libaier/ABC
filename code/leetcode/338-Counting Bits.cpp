// 338. Counting Bits My Submissions QuestionEditorial Solution
// Total Accepted: 13241 Total Submissions: 23746 Difficulty: Medium
// Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 ≤ i ≤ num calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.

// Example:
// For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

// Follow up:

// It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time O(n*sizeof(integer)). But can you do it in linear time O(n) /possibly in a single pass?
// Space complexity should be O(n).
// Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like __builtin_popcount in c++ or in any other language.
