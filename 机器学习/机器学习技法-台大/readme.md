###07 Blending and Bagging

* 四种集成方法
	* select最优
	* Uniform Blending
	* 不平均mix
	* combine the predictions conditionally

* 为什么集成会work
	* feature transform
	* regularization

* uniform blending(Voting)
	* even simple uniform blending can be better than any single hypothesis
	* reduces variance for more stable performance

* Linear Blending

* Any Blending
	* powerful, achieves conditional blending
	* but danger of overfitting, as always 

* Bootstrap Aggregation
	* 有放回重采样
